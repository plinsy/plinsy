        My job was to interpret the client needs, develop corresponding solutions and maintaining existing applications.
        I often work with a team with product owners, designers and developers.
        And sometimes, I manage projects by my own from scratch.
        We use tools depending on every projects needs, so Iâ€™ve mastered many of them by the way. You can see most of them in the next section. I mainly use Python, Nodejs, ReactJS and TypeScript.
